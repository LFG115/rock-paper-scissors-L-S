  and adds new thoughts, decitions and ideas to playing against the computer in this 1 v 1 scenario game.

  people of all ages who would would like to play a more complex game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Features

### Header

- Sitting at the top of the page in a soft blue colour with a clear font and bold black letters so it makes for easy reading,
  Inside the title is also a favicon that shows the hand gesture made by spock himself.
- Just underneath the title is an instruction title, to get you on your way into the game as soon as you would like.

### Game Options

- In the "Weapon Choice" options the user has 5 buttons seperated evenly and clearly and are displayed just under the game command,
  These options are interactive buttons that allow you to make a clear and accurate decision for beating the computer.
- Once a button "Weapon" has been chosen the game will begin.
  To start another round straight after just repeat with a different choice or the same one.

### Game Result

- Once the user chooses there option a related image to the users choice will appear and so will the computers choice.
- Both options will be displayed on a clear white background to make sure there is no confution on the outcome.
  
- If the user wins there will be a "well done" message, an image of the option the user chose,
  and a small description on how the user won.

- The score board is set directly underneath the main game to keep a tally of the users wins, 
  the computers wins and the draw score. All this information is set into colour coded boxes which are easy to see
  and understand.

### Rules

- The rules section which is located at the bottom of the page inside the footer had a simple,
   clean and clear diagram image showing which option beats eachother.
- As well as that underneath the image are the rules in a seperate easyto read box in text form.
  Just so the user is perfectly clear and can make an informed descion before clicking there choice.

### Bugs

#### unfixed

- I am aware of some uneven parts in the score board area,
  on mobile devices where some more styles could be done to tidy up the text.

#### fixed

- The main bugs I had to fix were to do with image cache in the rules section, and the colour transitions making sure they worked,
  and could read well.
